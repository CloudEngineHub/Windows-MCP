**Windows MCP** is a lightweight, open-source project that enables seamless integration between AI agents and the Windows operating system. Acting as an MCP server bridges the gap between LLMs and the Windows operating system, allowing agents to perform tasks such as **file navigation, application control, UI interaction, QA testing,** and more.

## ‚ú® Key Features

- **Seamless Windows Integration**  
  Interacts natively with Windows UI elements, opens apps, controls windows, simulates user input, and more.

- **Use Any LLM (Vision Optional)**
   Unlike many automation tools, Windows MCP doesn't rely on any traditional computer vision techniques or specific fine-tuned models; it works with any LLMs, reducing complexity and setup time.

- **Rich Toolset for UI Automation**  
  Includes tools for basic keyboard, mouse operation and capturing window/UI state.

- **Lightweight & Open-Source**  
  Minimal dependencies and easy setup with full source code available under MIT license.

- **Customizable & Extendable**  
  Easily adapt or extend tools to suit your unique automation or AI integration needs.

- **Real-Time Interaction**  
  Typical latency between actions (e.g., from one mouse click to the next) ranges from **4 to 8 secs**, and may slightly vary based on the number of active applications and system load.

### Supported Operating Systems

- Windows 10
- Windows 11  

## Installation

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.12+
- Anthropic Claude Desktop app or other MCP Clients
- UV (Python package manager), install with `pip install uv`

## üèÅ Getting Started

1. Clone the repository.

```shell
git clone https://github.com/CursorTouch/Windows-MCP.git
cd Windows-MCP
```

2. Install dependencies:

```shell
uv pip install -r pyproject.toml
```

3. Connect to the MCP server

Copy the below JSON with the appropriate {{PATH}} values:

```json
{
   "mcpServers": {
      "windows-mcp": {
         "command": "{{PATH_TO_UV}}",
         "args": [
            "--directory",
            "{{PATH_TO_SRC}}/Windows-MCP",
            "run",
            "server.py"
         ]
      }
   }
}
```

For Claude, save this as claude_desktop_config.json in your Claude Desktop configuration directory at:

```shell
%APPDATA%/Claude/claude_desktop_config.json
```

4. Restart Claude Desktop

Open Claude Desktop, and you should now see Windows-MCP as an available integration.

For additional Claude Desktop integration troubleshooting, see the [MCP documentation](https://modelcontextprotocol.io/quickstart/server#claude-for-desktop-integration-issues). The documentation includes helpful tips for checking logs and resolving common issues.
